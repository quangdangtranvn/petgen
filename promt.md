☕️ Sounds like you're brewing up something delicious in code and caffeine, with PetGen Fusion Promt Gen-AI! That promt.js file is already a tasty blend of AI prompt generation and smart contract interaction:

- The PromptAdapter class lets you whip up pet-themed prompts using a POST request to your custom API endpoint.
- The ContractAdapter class taps into ethers.js to mint NFTs and fetch pet ownership data from the blockchain.

If you're planning to “choco” it up today, maybe you're thinking of adding:
- 🍫 Chocolate-themed pet traits to the prompt generator
- 🧪 A mocha-style test suite to validate adapter behavior
- 🎨 Richer metadata flavors for NFT minting

Want help writing mocha tests or expanding the prompt logic to include dessert-themed pets? our tools base ready to stir the pot.✨️
