file ecs.js is currently set up to export anythingâ€”async or otherwise. There's complete packed export or module.exports statements, which means other files can directly import PetGen ECS class and update it.

âœ… Exporting  ECS Class
Hereâ€™s how you can make it exportable depending on your environment:

For ES Modules (browser or modern bundlers like Vite):
`js
export default ECS;
`

For CommonJS (Node.js-style projects):
`js
module.exports = ECS;
`

ðŸ’¡ And if you're planning to use ECS asynchronously (maybe with dynamic imports or async methods), you can still export it the same wayâ€”export default ECS is valid even if ECS has async methods inside.

## ðŸ“Š Estimated Percentages: Polygon vs MonoBehaviour Usage

_Assuming general usage patterns in game development contexts (e.g. Unity or similar engines):_

| **Component**                  | **Approximate Usage** | **Common Contexts**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Polygon (mesh rendering)      | 70â€“80%                 | Rendering 3D models, environments, characters; high in visually demanding projects  |
| MonoBehaviour (logic & scripts)| 20â€“30%                 | Game logic, interactions, behaviors; core to Unity-based systems                    |

> These percentages are broad estimates and vary heavily by project. A stylized game might be texture-heavy with fewer polygons, while a physics simulation might lean heavily on MonoBehaviour-style components.

Would you like help calculating actual polygon counts in a scene or designing your own ECS system that balances behavior and graphics? I'm here for all of it.
