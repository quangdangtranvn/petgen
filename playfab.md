To follow the PlayFab documentation and properly integrate its servicesâ€”like retrieving user data, managing authentication, or configuring backend logicâ€”youâ€™ll want to start with the official guides provided by Microsoft.

Hereâ€™s where to begin:

ðŸ”¹ Azure PlayFab Documentation  
This is the central hub for everything PlayFab. It covers:
- Game Manager setup
- Title Data and Player Data
- Authentication and identity management
- Multiplayer, economy, and analytics
- SDKs for Unity, Unreal, JavaScript, and more

ðŸ”¹ Getting Started with PlayFab  
This section walks you through:
- Creating a PlayFab account and studio
- Setting up your first title
- Using the Game Manager portal
- Accessing REST APIs and SDKs

ðŸ”¹ PlayFab Developer Portal  
Once you're signed in, you can manage your game titles, view analytics, and configure services directly.

If you're trying to use playfab_config.php to interact with PlayFab, youâ€™ll likely need to use the Client API to authenticate users and fetch their data securely. Let me know what specific functionality you're aiming forâ€”like login, inventory, or cloud scriptingâ€”and I can help you implement it step-by-step.
