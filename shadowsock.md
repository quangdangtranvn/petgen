# Full Setup Guide for Shadowsocks link  
`ss://YWVzLTI1Ni1nY206aGk=@2.2.2.2:8080`

## Step 1: Understanding your Shadowsocks link

Your link decomposes into:

- **Encryption method**: aes-256-gcm  
- **Password**: hi  
- **Server IP**: 2.2.2.2  
- **Server Port**: 8080

The link is encoded in base64 for the encryption method and password section, followed by the server and port.

## Step 2: Download Shadowsocks client

- **Windows**: Download the latest Shadowsocks Windows client from the official [GitHub release page](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases) or trusted sources. The client is usually a `.zip` archive. Extract it.  
- **Android**: Get "Shadowsocks" from the Google Play Store or from official sources.  
- **Other platforms**: Shadowsocks is cross-platform, also available on iOS, Mac, Linux, etc. See [shadowsocks.org](https://shadowsocks.org/) for official clients.

## Step 3: Configure Shadowsocks client on Windows

1. **Run** Shadowsocks client as administrator (`Shadowsocks.exe`).
2. **Add a new server**:
   - Click the “+” or right-click the tray icon → Servers → Edit Servers.
   - Fill in the server info:
     - Server IP: `2.2.2.2`
     - Server port: `8080`
     - Password: `hi`
     - Encryption method: `aes-256-gcm`
3. **Save** and select the configured server.
4. Enable the option **Associate ss:// Links** in the settings. This allows you to open Shadowsocks links directly by clicking them.

You can alternatively just click or paste the full `ss://` link inside Shadowsocks client if supported.

## Step 4: Connect and verify

- Click **Connect** or toggle the Shadowsocks client on.
- Once connected, you should see the tray icon change (green light or active icon).
- To verify, open a browser and check your IP (e.g., visit `https://whatismyipaddress.com`) to make sure your traffic routes via the Shadowsocks server.

For Android, after configuring the server similarly with the same info (server, port, password, encryption), toggling the connection shows a VPN icon in the status bar confirming active proxy connection.

## Additional tips and info

- If you want to import the `ss://` link directly, some Shadowsocks clients support this feature via scanning QR code or pasting the link.  
- Make sure no other VPN or proxy is running to avoid conflicts.  
- For Windows, right-click the tray icon to enable **Associate ss:// Links** to simplify future connections by opening links directly.
